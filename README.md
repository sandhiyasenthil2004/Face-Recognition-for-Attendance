# Face-Recognition-for-Attendance

This project is an automated attendance system based on face recognition technology. It replaces traditional manual or biometric methods by leveraging computer vision and machine learning to detect and recognize faces for marking attendance efficiently and accurately.

Features
Detects and recognizes faces in real-time.
Marks attendance automatically upon successful recognition.
Maintains a record of attendance in a database or CSV file.
User-friendly interface for managing attendance data.
Supports adding, updating, and deleting user records.


Prerequisites
Python 3.7 or later.
Webcam or external camera for capturing video feed.

Installation
1.Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
2.Activate the virtual environment
venv\Scripts\activate
3.Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
4.Download and set up pre-trained models
This project may use pre-trained models like dlib or OpenCV for face detection and recognition. 
Ensure the required model files are downloaded and placed in the appropriate directory (e.g., models/).
Run the application
python app.py


Usage
Register Faces: Add faces to the system by registering new users with their name and ID.
Mark Attendance: The system automatically detects and recognizes faces, marking attendance for recognized individuals.
View Attendance: Check or export attendance records from the database or CSV file.
Admin Panel (if implemented): Manage user data and attendance records.

Technologies Used
Python: For scripting and application logic.
OpenCV: For face detection and processing.
dlib: For face recognition and feature extraction.
